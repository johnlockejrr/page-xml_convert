Yes, it is possible to convert COCO (Common Objects in Context) labels to the PAGE-XML ground truth format, but it requires some understanding of both formats and how they represent annotations.

### Overview of COCO and PAGE-XML Formats:

1. **COCO Format**:
   - COCO is a popular dataset format that includes annotations for object detection, segmentation, keypoints, and captioning.
   - Annotations are usually stored in a JSON file, including information about images, categories, and segmentation masks (if applicable).
   - Each object instance is represented by a bounding box, segmentation mask, and associated class ID.

2. **PAGE-XML Format**:
   - PAGE-XML is a standard format for representing page layout information, primarily used in document analysis and recognition.
   - It uses XML to describe text regions, images, and their layout on a page.
   - The structure includes elements like `<TextRegion>`, `<ImageRegion>`, and others, specifying their coordinates and attributes.

### Conversion Process:

To convert COCO labels to PAGE-XML format, you would typically follow these steps:

1. **Read COCO Annotations**:
   - Load the COCO JSON file and extract the relevant information, such as image dimensions, categories, and annotations.

2. **Map COCO Categories to PAGE-XML**:
   - Create a mapping between COCO categories and PAGE-XML regions. For example, COCO's category IDs can be linked to specific `<TextRegion>` or `<ImageRegion>` elements in PAGE-XML.

3. **Create PAGE-XML Structure**:
   - Construct the XML structure according to the PAGE-XML schema. This involves creating the necessary elements for each annotated object, including their coordinates.
   - Convert the bounding boxes or segmentation masks from COCO format to the coordinate system used by PAGE-XML.

4. **Write to XML File**:
   - Save the constructed XML structure to a file in PAGE-XML format.

### Example Pseudocode for Conversion:

Here's a simplified pseudocode example to illustrate the conversion process:

```python
import json
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def convert_coco_to_page_xml(coco_json_path, output_xml_path):
    with open(coco_json_path, 'r') as f:
        coco_data = json.load(f)

    # Create the root element for PAGE-XML
    page_xml = ET.Element('Page')

    for image in coco_data['images']:
        image_id = image['id']
        width, height = image['width'], image['height']

        # Create an ImageRegion element
        image_region = ET.SubElement(page_xml, 'ImageRegion')
        # Add attributes for the image region (e.g., coordinates)
        # ...

        for annotation in coco_data['annotations']:
            if annotation['image_id'] == image_id:
                category_id = annotation['category_id']
                bbox = annotation['bbox']  # [x, y, width, height]

                # Create a TextRegion element (or other types based on your needs)
                text_region = ET.SubElement(image_region, 'TextRegion')
                # Add attributes for the text region (e.g., bounding box coordinates)
                # ...

    # Write the PAGE-XML to a file
    tree = ET.ElementTree(page_xml)
    tree.write(output_xml_path)

# Example usage
convert_coco_to_page_xml('coco_annotations.json', 'output_page.xml')
```

### Considerations:
- **Coordinate Systems**: Ensure that the coordinate systems match between COCO and PAGE-XML. COCO uses a top-left origin, while PAGE-XML may have different conventions based on the layout.
- **Region Types**: Determine what types of regions you want to create in PAGE-XML based on the COCO data (e.g., text regions, image regions).
- **Additional Attributes**: PAGE-XML may require additional attributes or metadata that are not present in COCO annotations.

### Conclusion:
While the conversion is feasible, it requires careful mapping of annotations and adherence to the PAGE-XML schema. Depending on your specific use case, you may need to customize the conversion logic to fit your needs.
